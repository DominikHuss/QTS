# \# TODO list
Not in any particular order.

- [ ] add logging, and everything that might concern it
- [ ] add model checkpointing, therefore saving and loading
- [ ] add support for cuda
- [ ] add soft cross-entropy objective AND random +- class data augmentation
- [ ] add plotting
- [ ] add partial mlm support for unseen data; proper masking and all
- [ ] think about distinguishing between different sample frequencies (e.g. daily vs hourly)
